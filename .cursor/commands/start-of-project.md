# 🚀 start-of-project.md Prompt

I am beginning a new project and need to initialize a structured planning system.

Please look at `master-plan` and generate:

## 🧩 `granular-plan.md`

- Create a **detailed, step-by-step task breakdown** for the entire project based on that of the `master-plan.md`.
 Include:
  - Actionable subtasks
  - Logical order of execution
  - Clarifications, edge cases, or technical considerations
---

## ✅ `master-plan.md`

- This file is **locked after creation**. The only changes permitted are:
  - ✅ Checking off completed sections or items
  - Optional appending of timestamped notes or summaries per section



Follow my modular planning rules:
- All structure comes from `master-plan.md`
- All execution happens within `granular-plan.md`
- No structural changes to `master-plan.md` are allowed after this prompt is complete

Let’s begin this project setup now.
