We are closing this conversation and transitioning to the next session. Please do the following:

---

## ✅ 1. Update `master-plan.md`

- Review the current `granular-plan.md`.
- Mark any completed tasks or entire sections in `master-plan.md` with ✅.
- Do not alter any structure — only mark progress.

## 🧩 2. Update `granular-plan.md`



---

## ✉️ 3. Generate Next Conversation Prompt
and place it in the start-of-conversation.md at the top.
- Provide a clean prompt I can use at the start of my next conversation.
- The prompt should:
  - Reference the updated section of `granular-plan.md`
  - Continue work on that part of the project
  - Be formatted clearly for direct reuse

This will close the current conversation, preserve all context, and fully prepare the workspace for the next one.
