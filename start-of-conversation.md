Please continue **Phase 15: Export System** from `granular-plan.md`, focusing on:
1. Implementing the actual Figma export service (pattern-aware layout translation + API/plugin integration) and remaining checklist items.
2. Enhancing the Cursor export path to include image asset packaging, bundle generation, and automated tests.
3. Wiring `/renderer-preview` query controls into a Playwright snapshot suite so exports have deterministic previews.

Kick off by reviewing the new `docs/export/export-mapping.md` + `lib/export/mapping.ts`, then plan the concrete implementation work.
